The Pokémon Search App allows users to search for Pokémon by name or ID and view detailed information including their name, ID, weight, height, sprite, and base stats. The app features a search form, dynamically updates the display with Pokémon details fetched from an API, and provides error handling if the Pokémon is not found.
